# Dragonfly

[![ci-tests](https://github.com/romange/dragonfly/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/romange/dragonfly/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A novel memory store that supports Redis and Memcached commands.
For more detailed status of what's implemented - see below.

Features include:
1. High throughput reaching millions of QPS on a single node.
2. TLS support.
3. Pipelining mode.
4. A novel cache design, which does not require specifying eviction policies.
5. Memory efficiency that can save 20-40% for regular workloads and even more for cache like
   workloads

## Building from source
I've tested the build on Ubuntu 21.04+.
Requires: CMake, Ninja, boost, libunwind8-dev

```
sudo apt install ninja-build
sudo apt install libunwind-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/romange/dragonfly
cd dragonfly && ./helio/blaze.sh -release
cd build-opt && ninja dragonfly

```

## Running

```
./dragonfly --logtostderr
```

for more options, run `./dragonfly --help`

In addition, we want to support efficient expiry (TTL) and cache eviction algorithms.
We should implement basic memory management support. For Master/Slave replication we should design
a distributed log format.

Commands that I prefer avoid implementing before launch:
  - PUNSUBSCRIBE
  - PSUBSCRIBE
  - HYPERLOGLOG
  - SCRIPT DEBUG
  - OBJECT
  - DUMP/RESTORE
  - CLIENT

Also, I would omit keyspace notifications. For that I would like to deep dive and learn
exact use-cases for this API.

### Random commands we implemented along the way

 - [X] ROLE (2.8) decorator for for master withour replicas
 - [X] UNLINK (4.0) decorator for DEL command
 - [X] BGSAVE
## Milestone Nymph
API 2,3,4 without cluster support, without modules, without memory inspection commands.
Without support for keyspace notifications.

Design config support. ~140 commands overall...
## Milestone Molt
API 5,6 - without cluster and modules. Streams support. ~80 commands overall.
## Milestone Adult
TBD.


## Design decisions along the way
### Expiration deadlines with relative accuracy
I decided to limit the expiration range to 365 days. Moreover, expiration deadlines
with millisecond precision (PEXPIRE/PSETEX etc) will be rounded to closest second
**for deadlines greater than 33554431ms (approximately 560 minutes). In other words,
expiries of `PEXPIRE key 10010` will expire exactly after 10 seconds and 10ms. However,
`PEXPIRE key 34000300` will expire after 34000 seconds (i.e. 300ms earlier). Similarly,
`PEXPIRE key 34000800` will expire after 34001 seconds, i.e. 200ms later.

Such rounding has at most 0.002% error which I hope is acceptable for large ranges.
If it breaks your use-cases - talk to me or open an issue and explain your case.
